The month of April marked a very exciting basketball season filled with tournaments for Middle and High school boys and girls teams. On April 1st and 2nd AISV hosted the VISSA boys basketball tournament for high school, as well as the middle school tournament from April 8th-9th. The event saw two thrilling weekends of great sportsmanship, teamwork, and showcasing the efforts of months of practice by the teams. We are very proud to announce that in the High School tournament finals, AISV was victorious over VIS 57-39 against VIS, making our boys team the first-ever VISSA champions. The tournament MVP, Eimantas Čiučelis, when asked about the difficulties of the tournament said, “A huge amount of games in a few days was definitely a challenge, especially for the people playing point guard position.” Reflecting on the results of the tournament, he claimed the AISV spirit was very strong, and that he thinks the AISV high school boys “did a pretty good job as a team, although there is always space for improvement!” He also highlights his teammate Victor’s performance, “If not [for]my teammate Victor Michael and his phenomenal performance, this could have gone the other way.” Other highlights of the high school boys’ tournament included: Five AISV players were selected in the ALL-Tournament team : Adomas, Victor, Titas, Emantas, Maxim.

### Finals MVP: Titas

### Tournament MVP: Eimantas

### Rest of the Champions: Xianminsheng, Joris, Andrius, Aleksej and Andreij

A big thank you to Coach Žydrūnas who has trained the team for the 3 months leading up to the tournament!

The Middle School basketball tournament, which took place the following weekend, also brought a lot of enthusiasm to the AISV gym. A most lively and entertaining pep rally preceded the tournament, featuring a game between middle school students and teachers, and a phenomenal performance from the AISV cheerleaders, led by Ms Elger, which brought school spirit to an all time high. The boys played many remarkable games, with the B team finishing fourth in the tournament overall after their loss to the SKM club (33-20), while the A team lost the championship game to VIS with a score of 53-26. The AISV B team also finished in front of the ISL Riga A-team as a B-team, which is an impressive accomplishment. In this tournament Emmet, Benediktas, Kristupas, and Darjus were selected in the ALL- TOURNAMENT team, and Javier, Léon, and Oskar’s team spirit and basketball IQ was highlighted as well. Overall, the tournament was a great experience for the high and middle school teams, and the teams were able to demonstrate all of the hard work that went into practices through a series of spectacular games. Congratulations to the boys’ teams, the coaches, the cheerleaders, and everyone who worked hard to make this tournament happen!

Meanwhile, the middle and high school girls were also putting their basketball skills to good use in the friendly game that took place at the local Pagiriai gymnasium on April 7th. Two games took place, one for middle school and one for high school girls, however due to an insufficient number of players, some of the middle school girls were a part of the high school game as well. The high school game was an exciting victory for AISV, while the middle school game was lost. Since a game was played against the same school in March which AISV had lost, it was very thrilling to see the progress the girls had made through the high school team’s victory in the April game. Hedy Huang, a grade 11 player on the team, said that although practices had become more challenging as “COVID hit very badly in January and part of February, and practices stopped for a while. It took a while to regain the strength and skills for the game.” During the actual game however, Hedy said that, “there wasn't really any difficulty besides that we were all shorter than the other team by a lot.” When asked about how the AISV girls did in terms of sportsmanship, Hedy responded, “We collaborated pretty well and everyone played an important role in the game. This can be attributed to the coaches Mr. Kurtz and Ms. Elger who emphasized the importance of trust in our teammates and how they will secure or defend their zone. The sportsmanship was strong, even though we lost the middle school game on April 7th and the high school game on March 29th, we still encouraged each other and didn't complain about the other team or blame our teammates. The spirit was also strong, we cheered for each other loudly when we were on the bench, especially when Masha made a three-pointer.” However, one of the less favorable aspects of the tournaments mentioned was that although the game was nice, “...the referee didn't call out many fouls that he should've called out, which was disadvantageous to us as we didn't foul as much as the other team.” Reflecting on what could be improved in future games, Hedy thought, “We should work on how to pass the defense set by the opponents.” We are extremely proud of the AISV girls basketball team, and hope to see more support and recognition of girls’ sports team in AISV in the future.
