With Easter having recently passed, some of you may be curious about the traditions surrounding the holiday, so hopefully this article answers some of your questions!

Easter is a holiday celebrated by Christians all over the world and is, of course, on a Sunday (at least we have a holiday on Monday to compensate for that). On a more serious note, this holiday is an old Christian tradition celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Though the first time it was celebrated officially is hard to identify, it is possible to assume that it happened probably at around 30 A.D. The holiday, as mentioned before, is celebrated on a Sunday, 14 days after the first Full Moon of spring (yeah, it’s weird). On that day families gather, go to churches and spend the day together. That day, a certain food is always present: the egg. Breaking the egg symbolizes the opening of the tomb where Jesus was left. Biblically, it is said that Jesus’ body was left in a closed tomb and was protected by guards, however after three days the body disappeared, showing that Jesus had returned to God.

Another interesting question would be: where does the tradition of dying eggs come from? Well actually, it is shown to come from the Christian community of Mesopotamia, where they dyed the eggs in a shade of red, representing Jesus’ blood and suffering. However, with time it evolved into something way more casual, simply decorating the eggs for the sake of it, generally not knowing the meaning behind it and simply wanting to make them pretty for that holy day.
