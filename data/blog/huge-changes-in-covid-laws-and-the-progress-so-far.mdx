​​Since the outbreak of COVID-19 back in late 2019, we’ve experienced loads of changes in our everyday lives, and on top of that, many new restrictions and regulations have come in place, including several global lockdowns. However, since January 2022, COVID has become less and less of a problem to us all, as the world continues to provide intense vaccination efforts. According to Our World in Data, as of March 26th, 2022, 58.1% of the entire world population, or about 4 billion people, have full COVID vaccination. The most recent widespread variant of COVID, Omicron, according to the CDC, is considered to be rather weak compared to other variants such as the Delta variant. Despite that, the Omicron
variant seems to spread easily in comparison to others. It goes without saying, even if COVID is slowly stopping, we should continue to be safe by washing our hands, wearing masks in required spaces, and isolating ourselves if we catch COVID-19.
