Hello dear readers, and welcome back from spring break! We are nearing the end of the school year, and there are only a few more issues of the Student Mirror to go! This 13th issue includes various articles, like a recap of AISV’s recent basketball events, the bestselling books of this month, the history behind Easter, the differences between the SAT and the ACT exams, and more serious topics, like sexual awareness month and the tragic loss of one of AISV’s beloved students. We hope this issue brings awareness to important topics, issues, and events.

### -Yours truly, the Student Mirror editors: Sophie Ali and Nastassia Tsialpuk
