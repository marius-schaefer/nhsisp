It is with deep sorrow that we write this obituary of a beloved student at AISV who has tragically passed away. Aleksej Radzolskij was a tenth grade student in our community, he had a bright, cheerful personality, and was always seen with a crooked smile. You’d hear his contagious laughter echoing throughout the hallways, and you’d see him in a red flannel shirt as he helped supervise lower school students. He was surrounded by such a generous, loving, and humorous aura. From playing guitar in the high school band, to dancing in front of the whole school dressed as a turkey, there was never a dull moment if Aleksej was there. Now his sun-like disposition shines from above, and we hope he is resting in peace. We send our condolences to Aleksej’s family and friends, who’s grief must feel insurmountable. We hope to commemorate Aleksej’ legacy at his memorial service that will occur tomorrow, on April 29th, at three o’clock. His ambitious spirit will be greatly missed by our community.
