In 11th and 12th grade and especially in the US, students take either the SAT or ACT standardized test to demonstrate their abilities for college application. Typically, every student takes the test from one to three times. Before COVID-19, most colleges required SAT or ACT scores to estimate the achievement of students on a standardized base. Even though the ACT is not as available internationally as the SAT, it is important to understand the differences to choose the right test that fits each student the best. Therefore, this article analyzes the specific strengths needed for each test, according to online resources, books, and private specialized tutoring center experiences in the US.

Both SAT and ACT (without writing sections) take about 3 hours long, but have different compositions. The SAT consists of a reading section with a variety of texts, including literature, science, history, and social science, a writing section about grammar and authorial choices, a no-calculator math section, and a calculator math section. All of these sections sum up to 1600 points with 800 maximum in English and 800 in math. Meanwhile, the ACT has a reading section, an English section similar to the writing section in the SAT, a science section that does not test scientific knowledge but rather critical thinking, a math section with a calculator, and an optional writing section that corresponds to the canceled essay section of the SAT. The ACT is out of 36 points, and the composite score is determined by the average of scores in individual sections. SAT is notably different from the ACT by incorporating a larger math section that determines half of your final scores. It also makes a distinction between a shorter no-calculator section and a longer and more complicated calculator section. On the other hand, the ACT has no such distinction and is less math-heavy, but incorporates a science section that focuses on scientific reasoning rather than content. Even within the English section, there are minute differences. Many have said that the ACT requires comprehension of the overall argument or thesis of a text while the SAT requires a deeper understanding of details. The time allowance for SAT on every question is also significantly longer, meaning that slower readers may perform better on the SAT and that the ACT requires the ability to skim through passages quickly. In short, the SAT is more suitable for math students as the math content is fairly easy with a higher weight in the final score while ACT is more appropriate for literature students.
In addition, the SAT is making transformations with its format. In January 2021, the College Board, the administration of the SAT, announced that they canceled the SAT Essay in the US, which is no longer or rarely a requirement in the US universities. However, the SAT Essay option continues to be offered internationally.. Recently, the College Board announced that the SAT will only be offered digitally starting in 2024.

## Popularity

Even though the SAT is internationally more well-known, the SAT and ACT have very close market shares in the US. Universities do not prefer one over the other. The reason for the popularity of the SAT can be due to its long history and its international availability. As of now, AISV and the nearby International Meridian School offer almost every SAT testing session. AISV does not host the ACT, nor do many of the other schools that offer the SAT in Vilnius.

## Which one should I take?

If you have ever reached out to a tutoring center, the center is most likely to suggest you take a practice SAT and ACT, then compare the results using an online conversion table to determine which test suits you the best. However, it is not always possible to find a testing center for the ACT with the ideal test date in Vilnius. In addition, buying an SAT or ACT book is more difficult in Lithuania and there are more available and well-known online SAT resources than for the ACT. Therefore, the SAT is generally more encouraged in AISV. However, there are also cases where people perform significantly better on the ACT, so judgment should be made after doing both practice tests. Although American universities do not prefer one over the other, choosing the test according to practice tests and personal strengths allows you to score higher and stand out against other applicants, increasing your chances of admission. After all, it is all about strategy and personal strength.
