### Trigger Warning: Sexual Violence

Sexual Assault Awareness month, a campaign which occurs throughout the month of April, was created with the purpose of educating people all around the world and raising awareness on what sexual assault is, and what we individually and as a society, can do to prevent it. Sexual assault is defined as “Sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim (rainn.org)” Sexual assault includes not only physical force, but also psychological force, emotional coercion, threats, and manipulation.

Sexual violence is a huge problem all over the world. In the U.S, 1 in every 6 women have been the victim of attempted or completed rape, and 1 in every 33 men have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. Many cases go unreported, because of victim blaming, and the fear that victims have that people will not believe them, so the numbers could be even higher. In the European Union, 1 in 3 women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence, and more than 1 in 10, or 11% of women, have experienced some form of sexual violence.
What is Denim Day?

Denim Day takes place on the last Wednesday of April. It is a campaign to advocate against victim blaming and stand with the victims of sexual assault. Denim day started after a 1998 Supreme Court ruling in Italy, in which a rape conviction was overturned because the judges deemed that because the victim was wearing tight jeans, she must have helped the perpetrator remove those jeans, therefore implying consent. The day after, the women of the Italian Parliament wore denim, to show that they were standing in solidarity with the victim. Since then, Denim Day has grown into a huge movement that fights against victim blaming, and strives to combat the harmful lies and rape culture surrounding sexual violence. During Denim Day, people are encouraged to wear jeans and other forms of denim. This year, Denim Day is on April 27th.
