Sophie Ali is a ninth grade student who has taken initiative and came up with the original concept of the newspaper. Sophie is passionate about journalism, music, and Taylor Swift just like Nastia, and together they work together to lead the Student Mirror team to reach their greatest potential. Sophieâ€™s creativity is always bringing new ideas to the paper, and she is always on the lookout for articles which has brought the newspaper many of its unique subjects. Sophie works on creating the calendars and planning the schedules of each issue, while also planning meetings, thinking of and assigning article topics, editing the articles once they are complete, and occasionally even writing pieces herself! Her kindness and positivity always contributes to the warm atmosphere of our meetings.
