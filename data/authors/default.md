The purpose of the Student Mirror is to create a student-led school newspaper that is organized by high school students. Working on a school newspaper is a great opportunity for students to explore the different roles involved in the writing process such as editors, journalists, photographers, and graphic designers. The newspaper also forges stronger connections within the community and allows students' voices to be shared on subjects they are passionate about, whether it is writers or the general student body which is strongly engaged in the pieces through surveys and interviews. The Student Mirror is perfect for students interested in journalism, as it allows them to engage in new experiences and try out the field. The editors of the Student Mirror, Nastassia and Sophie, founded the newspaper in order to create a community for students with similar interests to collaborate and work together creatively, and consequently produce an engaging product of information for members of the entire AISV community.

The Student Mirror includes articles tailored to the different interests of those within the AISV community, with articles ranging from reviews to interviews and research pieces. Students can find useful study tips and tricks, while teachers and parents can learn more about their students through surveys and interviews!

With a stable team of 20 members, the Student Mirror continues to grow! If you are ever interested in joining, email the editors, Nastassia Tsialpuk or Sophie Ali! If you would like to leave a suggestion, request, or general feedback, feel free to place a note in the Student Mirror Suggestion Box, located by the reception area.
